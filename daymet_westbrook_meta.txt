Variables and Units: 
Each daily record consists of 9 variables, described below:. 
1. year (no units): Year, repeated for each day in the year. 
2. yday (no units): Integer representing day of year, values ranging from 1-365. Where:
	yday 1 = January 1
	yday 365 = December 31 for non-leap years or December 30 for leapyears
	NOTE: All Daymet years are 1 – 365 days, including leap years. 
	The Daymet database includes leap-days. Values for December 31 are discarded 
	from leap years to maintain a 365-day year. 
3. tmax (degrees C): Daily maximum 2-meter air temperature. 
4. tmin (degrees C): Daily minimum 2-meter air temperature. 
5. dayl (s/day): Duration of the daylight period for the day. This calculation is based 
on the period of the day during which the sun is above a hypothetical flat horizon. 
6. prcp (mm/day): Daily total precipitation, sum of all forms converted to waterequivalent. 4
7. srad (W/m^2): Incident shortwave radiation flux density, taken as an average 
over the daylight period of the day. 
	NOTE: Daily Total Radiation (MJ/m^2/day) can be calculated as follows:
		((srad (W/m^2) * dayl (s/day)) / l,000,000)
8. swe (kg/m^2): Snow water equivalent. The amount of water contained within the 
snowpack. 
9. vp (Pa): Water Vapor Pressure. Daily average partial pressure of water vapor.
